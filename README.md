# Abstract
We construct a sentiment dictionary using newspaper articles from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and contemporaneous stock returns to determine which words are positive or negative in a financial context. Applying a Multinomial Inverse Regression model (MNIR) by Taddy (2013), we find that our constructed sentiment dictionary for bigrams relate to returns. We also create an alternative dictionary to compare with the MNIR â€“ which is based on simpler tools than machine learning. We find, using MNIR, that bigrams have internal validity and weak external validity.
